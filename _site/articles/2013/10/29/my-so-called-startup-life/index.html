				<p>When I started down this road I didn’t really know what to expect.  Would our little business, in this growing market, get enough attention to really prosper?  Would we be able to make an impact on the community in the fashion we had hoped to? So far the answer is sorta.</p>

<p>It’s been more than a year since my business partner, Mark, and I had started a community focused crowdfunding platform called <a href="http://www.uruut.com" target="_blank">URUUT</a>. When we first started out, I spent my days working as a developer for another company in order to pay the bills and would go home and spend many sleepless nights coding <a href="http://www.uruut.com" target="_blank">URUUT</a>’s beginnings.  You know what has changed since then?  Not much.  Still working a day job, still coding nights to squash bugs and support the business needs, still looking to expand. Along the way though, I’ve learned a few things about my process and about myself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Working all night long to try to “Get More Done” makes me worthless</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I rarely get much accomplished as I’m too tired to form coherent thoughts and in the morning I’m equally useless. I’ve recently decided to try to minimize these late nights and instead try to work toward getting up early and being more productive. Easier said than done but sounds better than the alternative.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Working from home is great but I miss interaction with others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve recently gone back to working from home and really do enjoy it in comparison to commuting to an office daily. My previous job found me commuting to downtown Atlanta daily which meant a one way commute of 1.5-2 hours. That’s 3-4 hours a day of non-paid, frustration filled time in a car that could be better used on other endeavors.</p>

<p>The only downside to working from home so far has been that I miss out on the interaction with co-workers and the usual water cooler chat. To remedy a bit of this I’ve found myself working out of coffee shops and book stores more often.  While this is really just a filler for the lack of back and forth I’d get at an office, it seems to fill the void for now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are holes in my development repertoire that need to be filled</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always prided myself on being a jack of all trades type of developer (PHP, Rails, Javascript, Front-End).  Until recently that has really served me well in my career but now I’m starting to see holes where I’m less equipped to fully contribute to projects where the rest of the developers are specialists in one discipline or another.  My decision to be a full time Rails developer was made a while back but for now, I’m in catch up mode to try and become the best developer I can.</p>
