    <p class="font-body text-lg md:text-xl text-[var(--fg)] leading-relaxed">
      VP of Engineering by day, tinkerer by night. I build teams, ship products, and get unreasonably excited about LLMs, automation, and anything that lets me delete code instead of write it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 font-body text-[var(--fg)]/90 leading-relaxed">
      I've spent my career bouncing between writing code and leading the people who write it. These days I'm deep in the AI engineering rabbit hole—building agents, wiring up workflows, and figuring out how to make LLMs actually useful in production. When I'm not doing that, I'm probably automating something that didn't need to be automated.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 font-body text-[var(--muted)] leading-relaxed">
      These are my field notes—things I'm building, breaking, and figuring out along the way.
