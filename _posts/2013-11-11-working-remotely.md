I've been working from home again for the last few months and I must admit, it beats the hell out of my 3 1/2 - 4 hour round trip I had previously.  

Of course, it isn't without its challenges. I now have to try to separate myself from my own home distractions like the tv, playstation, taking a nap, etc and make sure I focus on the task at hand.  It's been a bit of a struggle so far but I found a great <a href="http://99u.com/book/manage-your-day-to-day-2" title="Manage Your Day to Day" target="_blank">resource</a> to try and help me figure out my routine.  The book is broken up into small sections similar to the 37signals book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745" title ="Rework" target="_blank">Rework</a>, so it's very easy to digest. 

The bigger challenge has yet to come though.  In the coming weeks I'll be relocating my family and I back to Michigan to be closer to family. That means that not only will I be doing my day job from home but I'll now be running my portion of my startup, <a href="http://www.uruut.com" title="URUUT, A NEW KIND OF CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM" target="_blank">URUUT</a>, from home as well.  My other business partners will still be in Atlanta so we'll be relying even more on tools like hangouts and Skype for communication and keeping the business running.  

While I know it will be difficult and communication will change and adapt, the fear of change is still there.  I'm sure we'll be fine but lack of face time will be something we will have to work through.  

Wish me luck..
