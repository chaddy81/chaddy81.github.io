This isn't my first go round with creating a site/blog to both give myself a platform to share as well as a place to display my availability for work.  This is however the first time I'm venturing outside of Wordpress to do so.

So far I have been really impressed and enjoy using the tools I already use everyday to create other projects for myself.  Markdown is extremely quick and has a relatively low barrier of entry.  Github takes care of compiling and serving the jekyll framework.  I'd say the most difficult part of getting used to using a tool like Jekyll is getting your local dev setup and configuring everything, and that isn't too difficult.

If you'd like to give Jekyll a shot or just wanna check out the project, head on over to [jekyllrb](http://www.jekyllrb.com) and check it out.
